### Social Network

## Description
This is a university project that aims to implement a toy social network. The project was developed during the first semester of the second academic year.

## Technologies Used
- Java 17 SDK: The project is implemented using the Java programming language, specifically version 17. Java provides a robust and versatile platform for building applications.
- PostgreSQL: The database management system used in this project is PostgreSQL. It offers reliable data storage and retrieval capabilities, making it suitable for managing social network data.
- JavaFX: The graphical user interface (GUI) of the social network is built using JavaFX. This framework allows for the creation of visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.
- Gradle: The project utilizes Gradle as the build automation tool. Gradle simplifies the build process and handles dependencies, making it easier to manage the project's compilation and packaging.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 SDK must be installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use a package manager specific to your operating system.
- PostgreSQL database should be installed and running. You can download and install PostgreSQL from the official website or use a package manager.

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/social-network-repo).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a new PostgreSQL database for the social network.
4. Modify the database connection settings in the project's configuration files to match your PostgreSQL setup.
5. Build the project using Gradle: `gradle build`.
6. Run the application: `gradle run`.

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can access the social network's GUI and start using its features. The interface will provide options for creating an account, logging in, connecting with friends, sharing posts, and exploring other users' profiles.
