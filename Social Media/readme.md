# Social Media

This project is developed using the following Abstract Data Types (ADTs):

## 1. List ADT
I used the List ADT to store the chat history and friendship relationships between two users during runtime.

## 2. Ordered Set ADT
The Ordered Set ADT is represented as a binary search tree, which is the most efficient method for representing an ordered set. Adding and deleting elements in this structure is done in O(h) time, where h represents the height of the tree. However, the most efficient operation is searching, which is performed in O(h) time, approximating to O(log(n)).

I utilized this ordered set to implement events and users in the project.

## Usage

1. Run the application and navigate to the desired functionality.
2. Use the List ADT to store the chat history and friendship relationships between users.
3. Utilize the Ordered Set ADT to manage events and users efficiently.
